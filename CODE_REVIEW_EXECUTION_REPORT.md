All identified linting and type checking issues have been resolved:

#### **Backend Fixes**
✅ **Fixed 6 linting errors in @reactly/backend:**
1. `apps/backend/src/analytics/analytics.service.ts` - Removed unused imports (`NotFoundException`, `projects`)
2. `apps/backend/src/common/filters/http-exception.filter.ts` - Fixed bug: removed unused request variable, removed unused Request import
3. `apps/backend/src/projects/projects.service.ts` - Removed unused Project type import
4. `apps/backend/src/user/user.controller.ts` - Removed unused User type import
5. `apps/backend/src/user/user.service.ts` - Removed unused `userId` parameter
6. `apps/backend/test/setup.ts` - Removed unused Test import
7. `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` - Added test directory to includes for proper linting

#### **Frontend Fixes**
✅ **Fixed 1 linting warning in @reactly/web:**
1. `apps/web/components/auth-debug.tsx` - Fixed React Hook dependency warning:
   - Wrapped `loadToken` in `useCallback` with proper dependencies
   - Added `getToken` to dependency array
   - Ensures proper hook semantics and prevents unnecessary re-renders

#### **Shared Package Fixes**
✅ **Fixed 1 type checking error in @reactly/shared:**
